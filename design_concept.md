# Bodrum Edible Plants - Post Content Design Concept

## 1. Information Architecture (What info should be there)
To provide value and engage the audience, each post (plant profile) should contain the following structured data:

### Core Identity
- **Primary Name**: The most common local name (e.g., "Ebegümeci").
- **Scientific Name**: *Malva sylvestris* (Italicized).
- **Other Names**: Local Bodrum variations, English common names.

### Quick Stats (Metadata)
- **Edibility Rating**: 1-5 stars or specific tags (Edible, Medicinal, Toxic lookalikes).
- **Season**: Months available (e.g., "Nov - Apr").
- **Harvest Part**: Leaves, Flowers, Roots, Stems.
- **Location/Habitat**: Coastal, Roadsides, Fields.

### Deep Dive Content
- **Description**: How to identify it (leaf shape, flower color).
- **Culinary Uses**: Traditional Bodrum recipes (e.g., "Bulgur pilaf", "Roasted with eggs").
- **Health Benefits**: Traditional medicinal uses (disclaimer included).
- **Foraging Tips**: Sustainable harvesting, how to cut, what to avoid.
- **Cultural Notes**: Stories or history related to the plant in Bodrum.

## 2. Typography
Aim for an **"Organic Modern"** aesthetic—clean, readable, but with character.

### Font Pairings
**Option A: Editorial & Elegant**
- **Headings**: *Playfair Display* (Serif) – Feels traditional, botanical, and premium.
- **Body**: *Lato* or *Inter* (Sans-serif) – Clean and highly readable for long text.
- **Accents**: *Caveat* or *Homemade Apple* (Handwritten) – For "Chef's Tips" or local quotes.

**Option B: Clean & Nature-Focused**
- **Headings**: *DM Serif Display* – Bold and characterful.
- **Body**: *Outfit* – Modern, geometric but friendly.

### Hierarchy
- **H1 (Title)**: Large, high contrast.
- **H2 (Section Headers)**: Uppercase, tracked out (letter-spacing), smaller size.
- **Body Text**: Comfortable line height (1.6), dark grey (#333) rather than pure black for softness.

## 3. Imagery Strategy
Visuals should be lush, vibrant, and appetizing.

### Image Types
1.  **Hero Shot**: High-quality close-up of the plant in its prime (morning light, dew).
2.  **Identification Details**: Macro shots of leaf edges, stems, or flowers to help with ID.
3.  **In Situ**: The plant growing in its natural Bodrum habitat (with background context like stone walls or olive trees).
4.  **Culinary/Harvest**: A basket full of the harvest, or a prepared dish (e.g., Ebegümeci kavurması).
5.  **Botanical Illustration**: (Optional) A vintage-style line drawing overlay for a classic touch.

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Deep Forest Green (#2D4A3E), Earthy Terracotta (#C07A5F).
- **Secondary**: Sage Green (#A3B18A), Cream/Off-White (#F4F1EA) for backgrounds.
- **Accent**: Mustard Yellow (#E0A458) or Poppy Red (for specific flowers).

## 4. Post Content Layout UI Ideas

### Concept 1: The "Digital Field Guide" (Card/Modal Focus)
*Best for quick browsing on mobile.*
- **Header**: Full-width image with the Plant Name overlaid in white serif text.
- **Floating Action Button**: "Save to Foraging List".
- **Tabs**: [Overview] [Identification] [Recipes].
- **Content**:
    - **Overview**: Icons for Sun, Water, Season. Short bio.
    - **Identification**: Swipeable gallery of parts.
    - **Recipes**: Accordion style list of recipes.

### Concept 2: The "Editorial Blog" (Story Focus)
*Best for deep reading and storytelling.*
- **Sidebar (Desktop) / Top Bar (Mobile)**: Sticky Table of Contents.
- **Hero**: Split screen. Left: Large Typography (Name + Latin). Right: Hero Image.
- **Body**: Single column text with "hanging" images (images that break the grid).
- **Pull Quotes**: Large, centered quotes about the plant's history.
- **Interactive Elements**: "Harvest Season" timeline bar.

### Concept 3: The "Social Card" (Shareable)
*Best for Instagram/Pinterest style.*
- **Aspect Ratio**: 4:5 (Portrait).
- **Slide 1**: Hero Image + Name + "Edible?".
- **Slide 2**: "How to Spot" (Arrows pointing to features).
- **Slide 3**: "When to Pick" (Calendar visual).
- **Slide 4**: Simple Recipe Card.
